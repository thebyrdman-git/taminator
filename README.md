# TAM RFE Automation Tool

## 🎯 Overview

**This is the TAM RFE Automation Tool, developed by jbyrd as a standalone, self-contained solution that uses tools from [grimm's PAI project](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/gvaughn/hatter-pai). This IS the RFE automation tool itself.**

**The tool automatically generates and posts professional RFE/Bug tracker reports and Active Case reports to Customer Portal Groups, saving TAMs 2-3 hours per customer per week.**

### 🔄 Project Status
- **Developer**: jbyrd - Independent development
- **Uses Tools From**: grimm's PAI framework
- **Development Approach**: Standalone, self-contained solution
- **Current Status**: Active development and enhancement

### What This Tool Does
- **Automatically discovers** all RFE and Bug cases for your customers using `rhcase`
- **Filters cases** by SBR Group (Ansible, OpenShift, etc.) and status (Active, Closed, etc.)
- **Generates professional reports** including:
  - Active case reports (current open cases)
  - RFE/Bug tracker reports (3-table format with Active RFE, Active Bug, and Closed JIRA ticket history)
- **Posts content directly** to customer portal groups via Red Hat API
