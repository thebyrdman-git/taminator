# 🔒 Taminator Security Protection Layers

## 📋 TLDR

**For Contributors:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Complete security and contribution guide  
**For TAM Users:** This document is for developers only. If you're using Taminator, see [README.md](README.md)

**Security Layers:**
1. .gitignore → Passive blocking
2. Pre-commit hook → Active scanning  
3. Manual audit → Required before push
4. Code review → Human verification

**Blocks:** Customer names, case numbers, tokens, personal files

---

## Overview

Taminator has **4 layers of protection** to prevent personal and customer data from being committed to the repository.

---

## Layer 1: `.gitignore` (Passive Protection)

**Location:** `taminator/.gitignore`

**What it blocks:**
- ✅ Customer names (td-bank, wells-fargo, fannie-mae, etc.)
- ✅ Case numbers (case_04275428, etc.)
- ✅ JIRA IDs in filenames
- ✅ Personal files (oauth_credentials, youtube_token, etc.)
- ✅ API tokens and secrets
- ✅ Customer data directories
- ✅ User-specific configurations
- ✅ Build artifacts

**How it works:**
- Prevents files matching patterns from being staged
- Automatic, no user action needed
- First line of defense

---

## Layer 2: Pre-Commit Hook (Active Protection)

**Location:** `taminator/.git/hooks/pre-commit`

**What it checks:**
1. ✅ Customer/client names in filenames and content
2. ✅ Case numbers (case-12345678)
3. ✅ JIRA IDs (AAP-12345, AAPRFE-1234)
4. ✅ API tokens and secrets
5. ✅ Personal files
6. ✅ Email addresses
7. ✅ Configuration files

**How it works:**
- Runs automatically before every commit
- Scans all staged files
- Blocks commit if sensitive data detected
- Shows exactly what was found

**Example output:**
```
🔒 Running Taminator pre-commit security checks...
  Checking for customer names...
❌ BLOCKED: Customer name found in: src/example.py
  Line preview:
  customer = "td-bank"

═══════════════════════════════════════
❌ COMMIT BLOCKED - Security Check Failed
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## Layer 3: Manual Pre-Push Audit (Required)

**Location:** `.cursorrules` (Mandatory Rules)

**What it requires:**
1. ✅ Run comprehensive directory audit
2. ✅ Verify root directory structure
3. ✅ Check for personal files
4. ✅ Check for customer data
5. ✅ Get explicit user confirmation

**How it works:**
- Manual audit BEFORE every push
- Shows complete file list
- Requires confirmation
- Documented in `.cursorrules`

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check what files will be pushed
git ls-files | head -50
git ls-files | wc -l

# Verify NO personal files
git ls-files | grep -iE "(fannie|wells|fargo|td-bank|family-finance)" || echo "✅ Clean"

# Show directory structure
git ls-files | cut -d/ -f1 | sort -u
```

---

## Layer 4: Production Project Standards

**Location:** `.cursorrules` (Mandatory Checklist)

**What it enforces:**
- ✅ Production-ready code only
- ✅ Tested and working
- ✅ Documented
- ✅ No debug artifacts
- ✅ Security first
- ✅ Backwards compatible

**Before ANY commit:**
1. ❓ Is this code production-ready?
2. ❓ Is it tested and working?
3. ❓ Is it documented?
4. ❓ Does it maintain backwards compatibility?
5. ❓ Are there any debug artifacts to remove?
6. ❓ Will this break existing TAM workflows?

**If ANY answer is NO, do NOT commit.**

## Testing the Protection

### Test 1: Try to commit a customer name
```bash
echo "customer = 'td-bank'" > test.py
git add test.py
git commit -m "test"
# ❌ Should be BLOCKED by pre-commit hook
```

### Test 2: Try to commit a case number
```bash
echo "case_04275428_analysis.md" > case_file.md
git add case_file.md
git commit -m "test"
# ❌ Should be BLOCKED by pre-commit hook
```

### Test 3: Try to commit an API token
```bash
echo "api_key = 'abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx'" > config.py
git add config.py
git commit -m "test"
# ❌ Should be BLOCKED by pre-commit hook
```

### Test 4: Verify .gitignore works
```bash
echo "test" > td-bank-report.md
git status
# ✅ Should NOT show the file (blocked by .gitignore)
```

---

## Bypass (Emergency Only)

**DO NOT USE UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY**

If you need to bypass the pre-commit hook (NOT RECOMMENDED):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

**Warning:** This bypasses ALL security checks. Use only in emergencies and with extreme caution.

---

## Maintaining Protection

### When Adding New Customers
Add their name patterns to:
1. `.gitignore` (passive blocking)
2. `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (active blocking)

### When Adding New Secret Patterns
Update the `SECRET_PATTERNS` in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

### Regular Audits
Run monthly audits:
```bash
# Check for any leaked data
git log --all --full-history --source --name-only | grep -iE "customer|case|jira"

# Verify protection layers are active
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
cat .gitignore | grep -A 5 "CRITICAL"
```

---

## Summary

**4 Layers = Maximum Protection**

1. 🛡️ `.gitignore` - Passive prevention
2. 🚨 Pre-commit hook - Active blocking
3. 📋 Manual audit - Required verification
4. ✅ Production standards - Quality enforcement

**Result:** Customer and personal data cannot be committed to Taminator repository.
