## 🔥 Critical Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Update Tab - Removed Fake Checkboxes
**Before:**
```
☑️ Preserve custom notes and comments  ← Didn't work
☑️ Generate change log                 ← Didn't work
```

**After:**
```
ℹ️ What this does: Only status columns are updated - all your 
custom notes, comments, and formatting are automatically preserved.

📁 File locations shown after update
```

### Fix 2: GitHub Submission - Removed Fake Feature
**Before:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  resolve({ success: true }); // FAKE SUCCESS!
}, 1500);
```

**After:**
```
⚠️ Direct GitHub submission is not yet implemented.

   - Removed fake checkboxes
   - Removed fake GitHub form
   - Added demo warnings
   - Improved descriptions

## ✅ What Actually Works Now

1. **Trust is Critical** - Fake features destroy user confidence
2. **Honesty > Features** - Users prefer honest limitations over fake functionality
3. **Better UX** - Clear warnings better than misleading success messages
4. **Faster Support** - Honest docs mean fewer "why doesn't this work?" questions

### Applied Principles
- ✅ Remove fake features immediately
- ✅ Mark demo/placeholder data clearly
- ✅ Provide alternatives when removing features
- ✅ Document what actually works vs doesn't
