# 🧪 Taminator v1.9.5 - User Testing Guide

**Version:** v1.9.5 "The Honesty Update"  
**Release Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Purpose:** Guide for testing the new release

---

## 🎯 What Changed in v1.9.5?

This release **removes fake features** and **adds honesty** to the UI. We're not adding new functionality - we're being honest about what works vs what doesn't.

---

## ✅ **What to Test**

### Test 1: Launch & Navigation (2 min)
**Goal:** Verify app launches and navigation works

**Steps:**
1. Launch Taminator v1.9.5
2. Click through each tab:
   - Home (Dashboard)
   - Verify (Check)
   - Update
   - Post
   - Onboard
   - Vault
   - Settings
   - Report Issue

**Expected:**
- ✅ App launches without errors
- ✅ All tabs load successfully
- ✅ No crashes or blank screens

**Known Issue from v1.9.3:** Icon loading bug - FIXED in v1.9.4, should work now

---

### Test 2: Dashboard Warnings (1 min)
**Goal:** Verify demo data is clearly marked

**Steps:**
1. Go to Home (Dashboard) tab
2. Look for warning banner at top
3. Check card titles

**Expected:**
- ✅ Yellow warning banner says "Dashboard shows placeholder data"
- ✅ Customer card labeled "(Demo Data)"
- ✅ Recent Activity labeled "(Demo Data)"
- ✅ Auth Status labeled "(Live)"

**Why this matters:** Previous version showed fake data without any warning - users thought it was real!

---

### Test 3: Update Tab - No More Fake Checkboxes (2 min)
**Goal:** Verify misleading checkboxes are removed

**Steps:**
1. Go to Update tab
2. Look for checkboxes

**Expected:**
- ✅ NO checkboxes for "Preserve notes"
- ✅ NO checkboxes for "Generate changelog"
- ✅ Blue info box explains what actually happens
- ✅ Text says "automatically preserved"

**Why this matters:** Previous version had checkboxes that collected values but were completely ignored by the backend!

---

### Test 4: Report Issue Tab - Honest Contact Methods (2 min)
**Goal:** Verify fake GitHub submission is removed

**Steps:**
1. Go to Report Issue tab
2. Look for form

**Expected:**
- ✅ Yellow warning: "Direct GitHub submission is not yet implemented"
- ✅ Shows real contact methods:
  - Email: jbyrd@redhat.com
  - GitLab Issues link
  - Slack: #tam-automation
- ✅ NO bug report form with "Submit" button

**Why this matters:** Previous version had a form that returned FAKE success - users thought they reported bugs but didn't!

---

### Test 5: Tab Descriptions (3 min)
**Goal:** Verify all tabs explain what they do

**Steps:**
1. Click each tab and look for blue info boxes

**Expected:**
- ✅ **Verify tab:** "What this does: Compares your saved RFE/Bug tracker..."
- ✅ **Update tab:** "What this does: Fetches current status from JIRA..."
- ✅ **Onboard tab:** "What this does: Sets up a new customer..."
- ✅ Each has expandable "How it works" or "Where data is saved"

**Why this matters:** Previous version had minimal/confusing descriptions - users didn't know what tabs were for!

---

## 🧪 **Optional: Test Real Features** (if you have time)

### Optional Test 1: Update Report (5 min)
**Prerequisites:** 
- Real customer with existing tracker
- VPN connected

4. Wait for completion

**Expected:**

- ✅ Can expand "📁 File locations" to see:
  - Updated: ~/Documents/rh/customer/rfe-bug-tracker.md
  - Backup: ~/Documents/rh/customer/rfe-bug-tracker.md.backup

**NEW in v1.9.5:** File paths are now shown!

---

### Optional Test 2: Vault Token Save (3 min)
**Prerequisites:**
- HashiCorp Vault configured
- VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN environment variables set

**Steps:**
1. Go to Vault tab
2. Check connection status
3. Try to add a token (if you want)

**Expected:**
- ✅ Shows Vault connection status
- ✅ Displays VAULT_ADDR from environment

**Known Limitation:** Viewing and deleting tokens not fully implemented yet

---

### Optional Test 3: Settings Persistence (2 min)

1. Go to Settings tab
2. Change TAM email
3. Check "Auto-update"
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. Close Taminator
6. Reopen Taminator
7. Go to Settings tab

**Expected:**
- ✅ Settings you changed are still there

**FIXED in v1.9.4:** Settings now persist across restarts

---

## ❌ **What NOT to Test** (Known Limitations)

### Don't Waste Time On:
1. ❌ **Dashboard real data** - It's demo data (clearly marked)
